## Introduction

Welcome to the Generative Music project, a novel approach to music composition using the Transformer architecture. This project leverages machine learning to create and transform musical compositions, pushing the boundaries of traditional music creation.

## Features

- **Novel Compositional Approach**: Utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to generate innovative and unique musical pieces.
- **Real-time Composition**: Composes music instantaneously based on user input, perfect for live performances and adaptive soundtracks.
- **Diverse Musical Styles**: Capable of generating music across various genres, from classical to contemporary.
- **Customization and Personalization**: Allows users to tailor music generation parameters to their preferences, including mood, tempo, and instrumentation.
- **Musical Evolution**: Tracks and evolves musical motifs over time, creating dynamic and evolving compositions.

## Objectives

- Generate music based on user input or text prompts.
- Study the application of Transformer architecture in music generation.
- Explore future prospects of AI-driven music creation.

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- **Computer**: A device with at least 8GB of RAM and access to a GPU (NVIDIA preferred) for model training.
- **Speaker**: For audio playback of generated music.

### Software
- **Google Colab**: For running and training the Transformer model using Python.
- **Python Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyAudio, sounddevice, and other essential libraries.
- **Audiocraft**: For enhancing music quality and adding effects.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used within Google Colab for code execution and experimentation.

## Usage

1. **Music Generation**:
    - Provide text input or select parameters for the desired music style.
    - Run the generation script to create new music pieces.

2. **Music Transformation**:
    - Load an existing musical piece.
    - Apply transformations to create variations or new compositions.
